            Here are a few of my projects from GitHub, ranging from Ruby on

                A Ruby on Rails application that allows a user to create an
                itinerary and fill it with events (baseball games) extracted
                from an API. The user could choose a day and an event from that
                day, which would allow the application to show the next dayâ€™s
                events, continuing until the user stops adding events. The user
                will then be able to view their itinerary with all the details
                related to the events scheduled for each day.

                Additionally, the user can browse a list of recipes select one,
